Homework 1: Cipher

======README=======

- The provided program encrypt and decrypts files as described- in the homework decription page.

- The following assumptions were made:
  * outfile and infile cannot be the same
  * no option can be used more than once

- To make passing data easier, much of the data is passed ins structures. 

- To avoid the possibility of accidental assignments within an if()  statement, the following convention was used:

   "false == myBool" rather than "myBool == false"

  This way, a compile time error will be produced rather than a runtime    error.

- The "-s" option has bene implemented as part of extra credit

- The Makefile has been organized so that all source code is located in the src directory.
  * There are two makefiles, a parent and a child (in src directory).
  * A symbolic link to the executable is placed in the top directory so that we can run as expected
